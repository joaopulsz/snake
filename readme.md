## JavaScript Snake

This is a very simple project, yet one I am quite proud of, that I built to practice vanilla JS.

When I decided I wanted to build this game, I still was not aware that HTML canvas existed, therefore it is a bit clunky and the controls do not respond too well. Still, it was a cool challenge and great fun to make.
